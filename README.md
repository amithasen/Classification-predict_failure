# Classification Modeling
**Machine Learning to predict product failure**

Purpose of this project is to predict product failure for a transmission device based harware company. Machine Learning will enable proactive service to the client and also increase product quality. This approach is cost saving and time based preventive measure. This makes sure that tasks are performed only when warranted.   

Dependencies include python libraries like 
```
sklearn
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
```

Classification models used
```
Decision Trees
Ramdom forest
Logistic Regression
SVM
Niave bayes
```
